# 🧠 C++ Chess Game with AI (SFML)

A fully interactive, feature-complete Chess game built with **C++17** and **SFML**. Includes full rules of chess, a graphical UI, move logging, pawn promotion, and an AI opponent powered by **Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning**. Difficulty levels determine how far ahead the bot thinks.

---

## 🧩 Features

- 🎮 **Graphical Interface** — Built with SFML 2.6; supports all standard chess rules and interactions.
- ♟️ **Legal Move Generation** — Handles castling, en passant, promotion, check, checkmate, and stalemate.
- 🧠 **AI Opponent** — Uses Minimax + Alpha-Beta Pruning; depth increases with selected difficulty.
- ↔️ **Move Log** — Real-time move list on the right-hand panel using chess notation (e.g., `e2->e4`).
- 👑 **Promotion Popup** — When a pawn reaches the 8th rank, select a piece via an in-game modal.

## 🖥️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** C++17  
- **Graphics Library:** SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)  
- **Build System:** Visual Studio Code `tasks.json` or manual `g++` build

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

- A C++17-compatible compiler (e.g., g++ 11+, MinGW, MSVC)
- [SFML 2.6.2 or newer](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php)
- Visual Studio Code (recommended)

> 💡 Ensure SFML `.dll` files are in the same directory as your executable or accessible via your system PATH.

---

### ⚙️ Building the Project

#### ✔️ Option 1: Using VS Code Tasks

1. Open the folder in VS Code.
2. Press `Ctrl + Shift + B` to run the default build task.
3. The compiled `ChessGame.exe` will be output to the `build/` folder.

> Make sure your `tasks.json` file includes correct compiler and SFML paths.

#### ✔️ Option 2: Manual Compilation

Make sure SFML is installed. Then compile using the following command:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -g main.cpp Board.cpp Piece.cpp Bot.cpp ^
-I"C:/Path/To/SFML/include" -L"C:/Path/To/SFML/lib" ^
-lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system -o build/ChessGame.exe
```

> ⚠️ Replace `"C:/Path/To/SFML"` with your actual SFML install path.

## ▶️ Running the Game

```bash
cd build
ChessGame.exe
```

## 🎮 Gameplay Instructions

- **Startup Menu**: Choose your side (White or Black) and difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard).
- **Move Pieces**: Click to select a piece, then click a highlighted square to move.
- **AI Turn**: The bot plays automatically after your move.
- **Pawn Promotion**: A popup lets you choose a piece when promoting a pawn.
- **Move Log**: Shown on the right in standard notation (e.g., `e2→e4`).

## 🤖 AI Logic

The bot uses a **depth-limited Minimax algorithm** with **Alpha-Beta Pruning** for optimal performance.

| Difficulty | Minimax Depth |
|------------|----------------|
| Easy       | 1              |
| Medium     | 2              |
| Hard       | 3              |

Currently, the evaluation function is based on material value only.

> 🧠 Future improvements can include:
> - Piece-square tables  
> - King safety  
> - Pawn structure and mobility heuristics
